•The study compares discrepancies between 2D and 3D greenspace indicators.
•Significant differences in greenspace indicators are linked to landscape factors.
•Vegetation volume is higher than NDVI in urban/woodland areas; opposite in low-growing vegetation areas.
•Topographic factors like slope and elevation relate to 2D and 3D greenspace indicator disparities.
•Specific landscape factors influencing discrepancies provide insights for future greenspace indicator selection.
